# Basic Chatbot with Hugging Face Transformers

A simple chatbot project built with Python and Hugging Face's open-source language models. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of creating conversational AI using transformers and tokenization.

## Overview

This project showcases:
- Setting up a Python environment for NLP tasks
- Using Hugging Face's transformers library
- Understanding tokenization and transformer models
- Building a basic conversational chatbot

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip3

## Installation

1. Install virtualenv:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv chatbot
source chatbot/bin/activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m pip install transformers==4.30.2 torch
```

## Usage

Activate your virtual environment before running the chatbot:
```bash
source chatbot/bin/activate
```

Then run your chatbot script (add your main script here).

## Key Concepts

- **Transformers**: Neural network architecture for processing sequential data
- **Tokenization**: Converting text into tokens that the model can understand
- **Language Models**: Pre-trained models from Hugging Face for natural language processing

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Hugging Face Transformers (v4.30.2)
- PyTorch
